What is Enum?
    - If we want to represent a group of named constants then we can go with Enum's.
    - Main Use: If we want to crate our own data types then we can use Enum's.

    -   The following characteristics make enum a ‘special’ class:
        1.enum constants cannot be overridden
        2.enum doesn’t support the creation of objects
        3.enum can’t extend other classes
        4.enum can implement interfaces like classes

    -   Points to remember for Java Enum
        1.Enum improves type safety
        2.Enum can be easily used in switch
        3.Enum can be traversed
        4.Enum can have fields, constructors and methods
        5.Enum may implement many interfaces but cannot extend any class because it internally extends Enum class

    -    Java supports two types of Data Types:
             1.User-Defined Datatypes
             2.Inbuilt Data Types- int, float, double, char, etc.

Examples:
    ACTIVATED
    DEACTIVATED
    SUSPENDED
